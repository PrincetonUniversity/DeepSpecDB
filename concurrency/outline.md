# Applying Concurrent Search Structure Templates to C Code using VST (working title)
## Introduction

## Background
### VST+Iris

### Concurrent Search Structure Templates

## Templates
### Lock Coupling
hand-over-hand is tricky in VST

### Give-Up

## Proofs

### BST Functions
specs and proofs (sequential, no ghost state)

### Template: Lock Coupling
two kinds of ghost state: per-node and overall

### Template: Give-Up

### Top-Level Functions

division between program proof and separation logic implications on ghost state


## Delete
the need for more relaxed ghost state

challenging to give a nonatomic spec for pushdown-left, because it restructures the tree

delete is hard in most relaxed data structures! (references; also, has anyone done it well?)
