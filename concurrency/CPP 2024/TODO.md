## Review 1
- [] In Figure 1, the OCaml like traverse function is defined as taking three parameters ...
	The traverse here is repeated in Figure 2(a).
- [] In the displaymath specification of push on lines 250–3, surely the push call should refer to one of s, p or g.
- [] The displaymath on lines 331–339 has unnecessary blank lines before the post-conditions ... 
- [] In lines 506–514, the range identifier is a logical mess ... 
- []

## Review 2

- [] L9 : are a technique -> is a technique
- [] L247-253: Use parenthesis for arguments (to be consistent with rest of paper)
- [] L511: Parenthesis around if not indented properly
- [] L1076: can decomposed -> can be decomposed
- [] Figure 3: traverse_inv is missing its pn argument
- [x] Everywhere: Abs m -> Abs(m)
- [] The specification of traverse (L864) overflows into the margins
- [] 


## Review 3
- [] Add a reference of D. Shasha and N. Goodman, Concurrent search structure algorithms
- [] repeat the reference to [3] at the beginning of 2.1.1, when introducing the notion of atomic triples
- []
