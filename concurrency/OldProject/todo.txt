show the give-up invariant?

say something about the link template?

From previous:

refactor specifications so they are as much "the same" as possible, providing an interface of "local pred and public pred" (Lennart?)

For later:

linked list?

Make the template actually parametric. This includes:

make the insertOps the same across templates, e.g. by giving the data structure a way to call back into the template to allocate concurrency pieces

unify the treereps and nodebox_reps, using the inFP style for lock-coupling as well



flow interface version? maybe once we merge VST-Iris

lock-free templates
