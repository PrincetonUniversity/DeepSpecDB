File Organization for Template style

1) bst_template.c - C program of concurrent BST refactored as a form of template style
2) bst_template.v - AST file of `bst_template.c`
3) bst_template_lib.v - including neccessary library for verifying BST 
4) verif_bst_template.v - including specs and proofs of `findNext` and `traverse` functions
5) verif_bst_insert_template.v - including specs and proofs of `insertOp` and `insert` functions
6) verif_bst_lookup_template.v - including spec and proof of `lookup` function
7) verif_bst_delete_template.v - including spec and proof of `delete` function

To build them above, we need to build 
puretree.v
bst_conc.v
bst_template.v
bst_template_lib.v
verif_bst_template.v
verif_bst_insert_template.v
verif_bst_lookup_template.v
verif_bst_delete_template.v
