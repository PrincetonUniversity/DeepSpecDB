improve contributions in introduction
add background on Iris in VST
in section 4, explain why we have 3 separate specs instead of a single decisive-op spec
in 4.3, explain the issue with pushdown_left

refactor specifications so they are as much "the same" as possible, providing an interface of "local pred and public pred" (Lennart?)

redo proof explanations as needed (William)


For later:

flow interface version

new lock-free version
