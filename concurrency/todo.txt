get all the proofs up to the latest version
make names more consistent and representative, clean up proofs where possible
look for commonalities between lock-free and lock-based proofs
try to standardize the "extract lemmas" and capture some idea of breaking the proof into proofs about C and proofs about ghost-state tree structures
refactor specifications so they are as much "the same" as possible, providing an interface of "local pred and public pred"

flow interface version
delete proofs for lock-based
new lock-free version
