say something about the link template?

universal editing

From previous:

refactor specifications so they are as much "the same" as possible, providing an interface of "local pred and public pred" (Lennart?)

For later:

Make the template actually parametric. This includes:

make the insertOps the same across templates, e.g. by giving the data structure a way to call back into the template to allocate concurrency pieces

unify the treereps and nodebox_reps, using the inFP style for lock-coupling as well



flow interface version?

lock-free templates
