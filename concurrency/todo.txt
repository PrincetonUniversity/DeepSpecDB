get all the proofs up to the latest version -- almost done

add sorted_tree to tree_rep (if it's not already in Alex's tree_rep3)

check in Alex's delete proofs

look for commonalities between lock-free and lock-based proofs

try to standardize the "extract lemmas" and capture some idea of breaking the proof into proofs about C and proofs about ghost-state tree structures

refactor specifications so they are as much "the same" as possible, providing an interface of "local pred and public pred"

move concurrency stuff in VST to concurrency

prove a simple client to demonstrate that the implementations are interchangeable


For later:

flow interface version

delete proofs for lock-based

new lock-free version
