Notes on correspondence between the paper 
"Verified high-performance malloc/free"
and the C and Coq code.


* identifiers and symbols

in the paper | in the C/Coq code 
--------------------------------
W              WORD
A              ALIGN
WA             WA = WORD*ALIGN
mtok           malloc_token
mm             mem_mgr
rmm            mem_mgr_R
S              size2bin
\mapsto        memory_block  


* specs and subsumption theorems (in spec_malloc.v)

The 'strong spec' of malloc, used to verify the code, is malloc_spec_R.
The standard API spec of malloc is malloc_spec, and the resource-tracking 
one for clients is malloc_spec_R_simple.  

For free, the code is verified against the resource-tracking free_spec_R,
which is proved to subsume the standard API spec free_spec.


* notes
- in the code/comments, the term 'chunk' is sometimes used for user blocks, by contrast with other memory blocks
