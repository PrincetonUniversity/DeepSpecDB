Notes on correspondence between the paper 
"Verified high-performance malloc/free"
and the C and Coq code.


* identifiers and symbols

in the paper | in the C/Coq code 
--------------------------------
W              WORD
A              ALIGN
               WA = WORD*ALIGN - WORD (stands for waste, not W * A)
mtok           malloc_token
mm             mem_mgr
rmm            mem_mgr_R
S              size2bin
\mapsto_(n)    memory_block  
\mapsto_\tau   data_at 

In the code/comments, the term 'chunk' is sometimes used for user blocks obtained from
malloc, by contrast with other memory blocks.


* code 

- constants are defined in malloc.h and in malloc_lemmas.v 

- malloc, free, pre_fill, and helpers (excerpted in Figure 1 of the paper) are in malloc.c

- mmap0.c has the shim for mmap

- sample clients are in main.c, main_R.c, test.c 


* specifications, and definitions of mem_mgr etc, are in spec_malloc.v

- the basic specs (Figure 2) are malloc_spec, free_spec

- the esource-tracking specs (Sections 4,5) are malloc_spec_R_simple, free_spec_R
pre_fill_spec, and try_pre_fill_spec

- the third, stronger spec for malloc (Section 6) is malloc_spec_R 

- the subsumption lemmas (Section 6) are also in spec_malloc.v
  free_spec_R subsumes free_spec
  malloc_spec_R subsumes malloc_spec
  malloc_spec_R subsumes malloc_spec_R_simple 


* the proofs (summarized in Figure 3) are in several files, see verif_memmgr.v and README.txt
